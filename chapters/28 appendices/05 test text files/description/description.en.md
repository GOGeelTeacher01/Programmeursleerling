In Chapter
17
several small text files are used to demonstrate functionalities.
Moreover, in Chapter
27
I use a CSV file as demonstration. You can download these files either
from <http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook>{:target="_blank"}, or create them yourself. The
contents of these files are given below: just create them with any text
editor (you can even do that with IDLE), saving them under the name that
is given as title. The first one is a small excerpt from Shakespeare's
*Romeo and Juliet*, the second is a traditional English tongue twister,
and the third one is taken from Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking
Glass*. The last one is an example CSV file that I built.

## pc_rose.txt

    'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
    What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
    What's in a name? That which we call a rose
    By any other name would smell as sweet.
    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
    And for that name, which is no part of thee,
    Take all myself.

## pc_woodchuck.txt

    How much wood would a woodchuck chuck
    If a woodchuck could chuck wood?
    He would chuck, he would, as much as he could,
    And chuck as much as a woodchuck would
    If a woodchuck could chuck wood.

    JABBERWOCKY

    'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
     Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
    All mimsy were the borogoves,
     And the mome raths outgrabe.

    'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
     The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
     The frumious Bandersnatch!'

    He took his vorpal sword in hand:
     Long time the manxome foe he sought--
    So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
     And stood awhile in thought.

    And as in uffish thought he stood,
     The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
    Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
     And burbled as it came!

    One, two! One, two! And through and through
     The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
    He left it dead, and with its head
     He went galumphing back.

    'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
     Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
    O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
     He chortled in his joy.

    'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
     Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
    All mimsy were the borogoves,
     And the mome raths outgrabe.
