-   "oajns" indicated some spelling mistakes in Chapter
    10
    and in Appendices
    31
    and
    32
    (fixed in version 1.0.4).

-   Larry Cali pointed out an error in the code for Exercise 4.3, which
    could give problems with floating-point values which Python cannot
    store exactly. I fixed the exercise and made a remark on this in
    Chapter
    4
    (fixed in version 1.0.5).

-   Isaac Kramer noted a problem in Exercise 9.5, which made the issue
    in the code unnoticable. I fixed this to make the error actually
    occur as I explain in the Answers section (fixed in version 1.0.6).

-   Ruud van Cruchten indicated that my discussion of providing
    multi-line commentary in Chapter
    5
    was incomplete and could lead to problems. I have extended the text
    in this respect (fixed in version 1.0.7).

-   Nade Kang pointed out that the answer to Exercise 7.9 (second
    guessing game) could be confusing. I changed the code a little to
    compensate (fixed in version 1.0.7).

-   Shiyu Zhang noticed that listing 8.16 contained useless parameters.
    I corrected this (fixed in version 1.0.8).

-   Mustafa Amjed indicated several spelling and logical mistakes in the
    first 100 pages (fixed in version 1.0.8).

-   Woodgirl Martyr indicated a spelling mistake in Chapter 1 (fixed in
    version 1.0.9).

-   Claudia Dai pointed out a small mistake in the answer to Exercise
    10.1 (counting vowels; fixed in version 1.0.9).

-   Several of my students suggested adding flow charts to the chapters
    on conditions and iterations, as they would help understanding of
    how these concepts work. I followed that suggestion (added to
    version 1.0.9).

-   Mauro Crociara pointed out multiple typos and gave many ideas for
    improvements (incorporated in version 1.0.11).

-   Chris Spinks noticed some problems with the answer for Exercise
    21.4, the extended fruit basket, and the regular expressions in the
    answers to Exercises 25.3 and 25.4, where one is supposed to extract
    names from texts (fixed in version 1.0.12).

-   Patrick Vekemans noticed an error in the code in Subsection
    <a href="#ss:break" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ss:break">[ss:break]</a>
    (fixed in version 1.0.13).

-   Jose Perez-Carballo pointed out to me that the list of reserved
    words that I presented was actually the Python 2 list, which has
    undergone a few changes in Python 3 (fixed in version 1.0.13). He
    also pointed out a typo (fixed in version 1.0.14).

-   Jos Kaats indicated an erroneous detail in the calling of functions
    from functions (fixed in 1.0.14).

-   Luis Mendo Tomas had quite a few remarks which all lead to changes
    in the book, in particular the inclusion of a section on default
    values for function parameters (version 1.0.14).
