A playing card consists of a suit
(`"Hearts", "Spades", "Clubs", "Diamonds"`) and a rank
(`2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace"`).
Implement a `Card` class. Implement that cards are equal when they have
an equal rank, and that the other comparisons use the ranks in the order
given above (2 lowest, Ace highest). Test the class.
