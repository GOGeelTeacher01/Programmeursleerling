In Chapter
21
I gave the example of `Apple` and `Orange` both being subclasses of a
class `Fruit`, and `Student` and `Teacher` both being subclasses of a
class `Person`. You can implement such a hierarchy of classes and
subclasses using "inheritance."

Basically, inheritance is really simple. When you define a new class,
between parentheses you can specify another class. The new class
inherits all the attributes and methods of the other class, i.e, they
are automatically part of the new class.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__( self, firstname, lastname, age ):
        self.firstname = firstname
        self.lastname = lastname
        self.age = age
    def __repr__( self ):
        return "{} {}".format( self.firstname, self.lastname )
    def underage( self ):
        return self.age < 18

class Student( Person ):
    pass

albert = Student( "Albert", "Applebaum", 19 )
print( albert )
print( albert.underage() )
```

As you can see, the `Student` class inherits all properties and methods
of the class `Person`.

### Extending and overriding

![inheritance](media/Inheritance.png "inheritance"){:width="50%"}

To extend a subclass with new methods, you can just define the new
methods for the subclass. If you define methods that already exist in
the parent class (or "superclass"), they "override" the parent class
methods, i.e., they use the new method as specified by the subclass.

Often, when you override a method, you still want to use the method of
the parent class. For instance, if the `Student` class needs a list of
courses in which the student is enrolled, the course list must be
initialized as an empty list in the `__init__()` method. Yet if I
override the `__init__()` method, the student's name and age are no
longer initialized, unless I make sure that they are. You can make a
copy of the `__init__()` method for `Person` into `Student` and adapt
that copy, but it is better to actually call the `__init__()` method of
`Person` inside the `__init__()` method of `Student`. That way, should
the `__init__()` method of `Person` change, there is no need to update
the `__init__()` method of `Student`.

There are two ways of calling a method of another class: by using a
"class call," or by using the `super()` method.

A class call entails that a method is called using the syntax
`<classname>.<method>()`. So, to call the `__init__()` method of
`Person`, I can write `Person.__init__()`. I am not limited to calling
methods of the superclass this way; I can call methods of any class.
Since such a call is not a regular method call, you have to supply
`self` as an argument. So, for the code above, to call the `__init__()`
method of `Person` from the `__init__()` method of `Student`, you write
`Person.__init__( self, firstname, lastname, age )` (I am allowed to use
`self` here because every instance of `Student` is also an instance of
`Person`, as `Student` is a subclass of `Person`).

Using `super()` means that you can directly refer to the superclass of a
class by using the standard function `super()`, without knowing the name
of the superclass. So to call the `__init__()` method of the superclass
of `Student`, I can write `super().__init__()`. You do not supply `self`
as the first argument if you use `super()` like this. So, for the code
above, to call the `__init__()` method of `Person` from the `__init__()`
method of `Student`, you write
`super().__init__( firstname, lastname, age )`.

Of these two approaches, I prefer the use of `super()`, but only in this
specific way: to call the immediate superclass in single-class
inheritance. `super()` can be called in different ways and has a few
intricacies, which I will get to below.

In the code below, the class `Student` gets two new attributes: a
program and a course list. The method `__init__()` gets overridden to
create these new attributes, but also calls the `__init__()` method of
`Person`. `Student` gets a new method, `enroll()`, to add courses to the
course list. Finally, as a demonstration I overrode the method
`underage()` to make students underage when they are not 21 yet (sorry
about that).

```python
class Person:
    def __init__( self, firstname, lastname, age ):
        self.firstname = firstname
        self.lastname = lastname
        self.age = age
    def __repr__( self ):
        return "{} {}".format( self.firstname, self.lastname )
    def underage( self ):
        return self.age < 18

class Student( Person ):
    def __init__( self, firstname, lastname, age, program ):
        super().__init__( firstname, lastname, age )
        self.courselist = []
        self.program = program
    def underage( self ):
        return self.age < 21
    def enroll( self, course ):
        self.courselist.append( course )

albert = Student( "Albert", "Applebaum", 19, "CSAI" )
print( albert )
print( albert.underage() )
print( albert.program )
albert.enroll( "Methods of Rationality" )
albert.enroll( "Defense Against the Dark Arts" )
print( albert.courselist )
```

### Multiple inheritance

You can create a class that inherits from multiple classes. This is
called "multiple inheritance." You specify all the superclasses, with
commas in between, between the parentheses of the class definition. The
new class now forms a combination of all the superclasses.

When a method is called, to decide which method implementation to use,
Python first checks whether it exists in the class for which the method
is called itself. If it is not there, it checks all the superclasses,
from left to right. As soon as it finds an implementation of the method,
it will execute it.

If you want to call a method from a superclass, you have to tell Python
which superclass you wish to call. You best do that directly with a
class call. However, you can use `super()` for this too, but it is
pretty tricky. You provide the order in which the classes should be
checked as arguments to `super()`. However, the first argument is not
checked by `super()` (I assume that it is supposed to be `self`).

It is something like this: You have three classes, A, B, and C. You
create a new class D which inherits from all other three classes, by
defining it as `class D( A, B, C )`. When in the `__init__()` method of
D you want to call the `__init__()` methods of the three parent classes,
you can call them using class calls as `A.__init__()`, `B.__init__()`,
and `C.__init__()`. However, if you want to call the `__init__()` method
of one of them, but you do not know exactly which, but you do know the
order in which you want to check them (for instance, B, C, A), then you
can call `super()` with `self` as the first argument and the other three
classes following it in the order in which you want to check them (for
instance, `super( self, B, C, A ).__init__()`).

As I said, it is pretty tricky. Multiple inheritance is tricky anyway.
My general recommendation is that you do not use it, unless there is
really no way around it. Many object oriented languages do not even
support multiple inheritance, and those that do tend to warn against
using it.

So I am not even going to give an example of using multiple inheritance,
and neither am I going to supply exercises for multiple inheritance. You
should simply avoid using it, until you have a lot of experience with
Python and object oriented programming. And by that time, you probably
see ways of constructing your programs that do not need multiple
inheritance at all.
