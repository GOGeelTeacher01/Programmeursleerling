Most chapters have small exercises sprinkled throughout the text. These
exercises are there to enlighten a point or for you to do a quick check
if you understood the material up to that moment. You should try to do
these exercises immediately when you encounter them. Answers to these
exercises are seldom provided, because if you understood the material,
they should be really easy to do, while if you did not understand the
material, you should either re-read the chapter until you do, or ask
someone for assistance.

At the end of most chapters, a separate "Exercises" section is given,
with one or more numbered exercises. You are supposed to do all of these
exercises, and you should be able to do them independently (i.e.,
without help of other people and without looking up solutions from
outside sources). Answers to these numbered exercises are provided in
the back of the book, in Appendix
34,
and can also be downloaded from the website associated with this book
(<http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook>{:target="_blank"}). I wish to stress the following
points:

-   You should work on the numbered exercises until you have solved
    them. Do not dabble a bit and then look up the answer. Such an
    approach is utterly useless. There is no way that you are going to
    learn programming if you do not think about algorithms, write code,
    and test code. If you cannot solve an exercise even after you have
    worked on it for quite some time, it is better to ask for assistance
    than to just look up the answer. Being unable to solve an exercise
    means that there is something in the material that you have not
    grasped yet, and it is important that you identify what that is, and
    get to grips with it.

-   You should do all of the exercises. The only way to learn
    programming is by practicing. You will have to write lots and lots
    of code before you have internalized the practice of programming.
    The few exercises that I place at the end of the chapters are not
    enough to accomplish that, but at least they are a start. If you
    cannot even bother to do all of those, you should not bother to try
    to learn programming.

-   You should try to do the exercises independently. Working in teams
    on the exercises will allow one member of the team to learn, while
    the rest sits by and learns nothing. Students often say that they
    have a method of learning from assignments that involves working on
    them in small groups and discussing. That may be fine for analyzing
    texts or setting up an experiment, but in general does not work for
    coding. Watching someone write code teaches you very little about
    writing code. You have to write code by yourself.

-   For none of the exercises you need information that was not
    discussed in the book up to that point. While there definitely may
    be easier ways to do some of the exercises if you would use Python
    constructs that I did not discuss yet at the time you get to the
    exercises, you do not need them. The purpose of the exercises is to
    practice with the discussed material. They are not meant to let you
    investigate future material. Even if you are aware of different ways
    to solve an exercise, try to do it with only the material discussed.
    Once you have done that, if you want to return to an exercise later
    and solve it in a different way, that is, of course, fine.

-   Once you have solved an exercise by yourself and have tested it
    extensively, then and only then you should compare it to the answer
    that I provided. You may find that it is different from yours. That
    does not mean that your answer is wrong! There are usually very many
    ways to solve a programming problem. Some might be "better" in some
    way than others. But there are many answers that are equally
    correct. Moreover, in this book it is important that you learn to
    solve a problem by coding, not that you learn to code the most
    efficient solution to a problem. Just being able to solve the
    problem suffices, making solutions more efficient is of much lesser
    importance. For instance, "being efficient" is less important than
    "being easy to understand" and "being easy to maintain."

For starters, here are two numbered exercises for the first chapter.
