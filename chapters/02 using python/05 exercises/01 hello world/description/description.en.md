Download Python and install it on the
machine of your choice. Run IDLE. Create a file `hello.py`, in which you
place the code of the *Hello World* program shown in Chapter
2
â€“ it consists of one line of code, namely:

```python
print( "Hello, world!" )
```

Run the program, and observe how the text "Hello, world!" is displayed
in the IDLE shell.
