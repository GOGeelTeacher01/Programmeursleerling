Besides this book, you might occasionally want to reference the Python
manual. The easiest way to do that is using the Internet. Just search
for "Python" with whatever you are interested in, and you will quickly
see links that lead straight into the Python manuals (the Python manuals
are stored at <http://docs.python.org>{:target="_blank"}). You might also run into links
that lead you to code that solves a problem for you directly. While that
is great by the time you have to use Python for practical problems, it
does not help you to learn. So my advice is that you avoid such links
while trying to learn programming.

When you install Python, there usually is a manual installed in a Doc
folder under the Python folder. You can use it if, for some reason, you
are not connected to the Internet.

If you are interested in another book besides this one, I recommend the
classic *Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist*, by Allen
B. Downey. It is freely available from <http://greenteapress.com/wp/>{:target="_blank"}. A
version for Python 3 was released in 2016. The main differences with my
book as far as content is concerned, is that my book has more exercises,
is aimed more at people who are completely new to programming, takes
more time for topics that I know are hard for students who have no real
aptitude for programming, and covers a few important topics that
Downey's book lacks, such as extensive file processing.

Besides this book and other books like it to learn Python from, there
are several open video courses available. I do not believe that it is
possible to learn programming mainly from watching a video. The only way
to learn programming is by doing.

I have included a troubleshooting appendix (Appendix
29)
to explain the most common problems that you may encounter during the
writing and running of programs.
